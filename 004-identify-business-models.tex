\section{Identify Business models}

\section{Description}

\par Identify the main (and complementary) business models adopted by five of the following companies:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Liferay
  \item Eucalyptus
  \item Acquia
  \item BlackDuck
  \item Zimbra
  \item IBM (libre software projects)
  \item Jaspersoft
  \item Funambol
\end{itemize}

\par In every case, document your answers as much as possible. In all the cases, there is relevant information in the Net that of course you should use.

\section{Business models around FLOSS}

\par First of all, we have to define which are FLOSS business models using \emph{FLOSSMetrics OpenTTT guides Analysis}\cite{floss-bm}

\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Open core} - Based on dual licensing, but this is not the business foundation. 

	\item \emph{Product specialists} - Company offering or creating maintainance for a specific software product, usually in a concrete market.

	\item \emph{Platform providers} - Selection, support, integration and services around a set of projects integrated in a single, tested and verified product.

	\item \emph{Aggregate support providers} - Centralized support point for different libre software products.

	\item \emph{Selection/consulting companies} - Assessment about selection and evaluation of software products and services.

	\item \emph{Legal certification/consulting} - Legal assessment for companies about complex problems derived from multiplicity of libre software FLOSS licenses and their compatibilities.

	\item \emph{Training and documentation} - Focused on important aspects of libre software, but not directly related to development.

	\item \emph{R\&D cost sharing} - Company interested in software development decides to release the code to benefit from contributions from large community of interested developers.

	\item \emph{Indirect revenues} - Companies that decide to develop libre software or funding libre software projects to leverage their business on related products.

\end{itemize}

\par And of course, \emph{FLOSS is not a business model itself}.
