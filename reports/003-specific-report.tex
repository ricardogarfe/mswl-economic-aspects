\section{Specific report}

Minimum: 20 points, maximum: 80 points
Specific report about a certain business model or strategy based on FLOSS, showing its general aspects, but also analyzing companies already putting it into place, discussing advantages and drawbacks of the model, etc. A detailed DAFO analysis has to be a part of the report.

As a result of this activity, the student should produce:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A ‘traditional’ written report.
    \item A video or audio presentation (10 min. maximum).
    \item A set of slides supporting the presentation.
\end{itemize}

It is important to detail all the references, and to heavily root the report on data and/or specific works publicly available. The video or audio presentation wil be uploaded to some audio or video web hosting site which allows for download of the whole audio or video file, not only streaming (eg, blip.tv)
